# Questions

##### Assuming the Star Wars API was slow, what are some optimizations that could be implemented to improve the user experience?

- A loading spinner to indicate data are loading
- Lazy loading - to show placeholders or a layout of greyed-out data so that users will know to expect more data will be displayed shortly
- Use `React.fragments` `<></>` to avoid extra node.

##### Any improvements you would make to your application?

- Implement more CSS
- Create more subdata details page such as Planets, Starships etc. If we do so, we should add the routers in App.js and add individual subdata component for each type of details page. We should also remove `withLink` and `pathname` props as well as the tenary operator for showing either anchor links or plain list items, because these will no longer be needed if all shall display as accessible anchor links
- Instead of passing down state via the `<Link>` component, we can have better state management with Context API or Redux, so that all states are retrievable in different components, not just by accessing specific links in the Film Details page.
- Further refactoring out custom hooks so functions are separated from the component display
- Implement testing frameworks

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
